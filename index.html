          As you know, I’m Mikael Nortikyan. I was born on March 31st, 1999, so I’m still considered a 90s kid. 98.37 % of the teachers I’ve had throughout my life have gotten my name wrong as you can imagine. Well, I’m into listening to music, coding (obviously), making jokes or parodies. I like to create or do things that others haven’t thought of yet. I would like to say that I started the speaker trend at school, an I’m not talking about the little crappy speakers, I’m talking about the actual loud and nice ones! As you can tell from my last name, I’m Armenian brrro, but that doesn’t mean that I listen to Armenian music only. I mostly listen to Old School Rap or Gangsta Rap, but I also listen to new artists like YG, DJ Mustard, Rick Ross, Drake, and more. I like pranking people, I won’t say what I’ve done, but trust me when I say I do. I like watching the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Married… With Children, Family Guy, The Simpsons, American Dad, and a lot more shows. If you ever wanna ask me anything more about me, here’s a link for ya: <a href="http://ask.fm/miko_47">http://ask.fm/miko_47</a>
